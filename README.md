# DabReports

This plugin was made by me and [NobreHD](https://github.com/NobreHD). It's a plugin for bungeecord that essentially allows players to report other players and have the report spat out into a discord channel.

Installing the plugin is easy:
1. Install plugin into /plugins/
2. Start Bungeecord/Velocity
3. Get the error that tells you that you need to fill out the config.yml
4. Insert the webhook URL, the Profile picture URL, and the name of the little bot that give you all of your cool player reports 
5. Make friends with the plugin


WARNING!!

- I no longer support Bungeecord nor Waterfall for any new updates. Please use [Velocity](https://papermc.io/downloads/velocity) for the forseeable future!
- The main fork will always be the latest version, to choose your version you need to select the correct fork.

Other Note:
I picked this up again because I saw it was two years out of date
